Test Problems for Regularization Methods
========================================

A Fredholm integral equation of the first kind (in 1-dimensional) can
be written as
 
.. math::

   \int_{0}^1 K(s,t) f(t) dt = g(s), \quad 0 \leq s \leq 1,

where :math:`g` and :math:`K` (called kernel) are known functions
and :math:`f` is the unknown solution. This is a classical example of
a linear ill-posed problem, i.e., an arbitrary small perturbation of
the data can cause an arbitrarily large perturbation of the
solution. For example, in computerized tomography, :math:`K` is an
X-ray source, :math:`f` is the object being scanned, and :math:`g` is
the measured damping of the X-rays. The goal here is to reconstruct
the scanned object from information about the locations of the X-ray
sources and measurements of their damping.

After discretizations (by the quadrature method or the Galerkin
method), we obtain a linear system of equations :math:`Ax=b`. 
All the regularization test problems are derived from 
discretizations of a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind.
Each generated test problem has type ``RegProb``, which is
defined as::

  immutable RegProb{T}
    A::AbstractMatrix{T}  # matrix of interest
    b::AbstractVector{T}  # right-hand side
    x::AbstractVector{T}  # the solution to Ax = b
  end

Here is an example::

  julia> mdinfo("deriv2")
  Computation of the Second Derivative:
             
  A classical test problem for regularization algorithms.
  
  Input options:
             
  1. [type,] n, [matrixonly]: the dimension of the matrix is n. 
             If matrixonly = false, the linear system A, b, x will be generated. 
             (matrixonly = true by default.)

      with :math:`\sigma = 0.014234` and it is discretized by means of
      a Galerkin method with n orthonormal basis functions. The
      right-hand side b consists of a measured distribution function of
      stellar parallaxes, and its length is fixed at 26; i.e., the
      matrix :math:`A` is :math:`26\times n`. The exact solution, which
      represents the true distribution of stellar parallaxes, is
      unknown.
