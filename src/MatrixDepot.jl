    MatrixDepot

Give access to a wealth of sample and test matrices and accompanying data.
A set of matrices is generated locally (with arguments controlling the special case).
Another set is loaded from one of the publicly accessible matrix collections
`SuiteSparse Matrix Collection` (formerly `University of Florida Matrix Collection`)
and the `Matrix Market Collection`.

Access is like

    using MatrixDepot

    A = matrixdepot("hilb", 10) # locally generated hilbert matrix dimensions (10,10)
    
    A = matrixdepot("HB/1138_bus")     # named matrix of the SuiteSparse Collection
    A = matrixdepot(sp(1))             # same matrix using numerical id
    A = matrixdepot("Harwell*/*/1138_bus") # matrix from the Matrix Market Collection 

    md = mdopen("*/bfly")   # named matrix with some extra data
    A = md.A
    co = md.coord
    tx = md("Gname_10.txt")

    md = mdopen("gravity", 10, false) # localy generated example with rhs and solution
    A = md.A
    b = md.b
    x = md.x

###### commands:
    mdinfo, listdir, listgroups, matrixdepot, mdopen, listdata, mdlist,
    metasymbols, @addgroup, @modifygroup, @rmgroup.
###### selector patterns:
    strings, string-patterns (using "*", "?", "/", "**"), regular expressions: for names
    builtin(42), user(3,5), sp(10:11,6,2833), mm(1): to access by integer id
###### predicate patterns:
    isboolean, isinteger, isreal, iscomplex
    isgeneral, issymmetric, ishermitian, isskew
    isbuiltin, isuser, islocal, isremote, isloaded, isunloaded
    keyword(string expression), logical, hasdata(symbol), @pred(expression)

    see also: "logical" for logical combinations of all kinds of patterns.
